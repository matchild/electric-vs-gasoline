## Description:
The parameters are the following:
* Gasoline price (€/L)
* Electricity price (€/kWh)
* Gas efficiency (L/100km)
* Electric efficiency (kWh/100km)

Standard values are set for a Renault Twingo (full electric) and a Kia Venga (gasoline).
By setting a trip length in kilometers it is possible to calculate how much the trip would cost with either car.


## Disclaimer:
This is simply a calculator that estimates the cost of a trip. Before buying an electric car it is definitely worth checking local gas/electricity price, charging station availability, average temperature and other factors.
